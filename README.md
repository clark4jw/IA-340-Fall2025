# IA 340 Code

This is my [IA 340](https://catalog.jmu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=50&coid=258336&print) course code. 

"*Data mining* is the nontrivial extraction of previously unknown and potential useful information from (large) data sets to help explain current behaviors and anticipate *future outcomes*. Students will apply data mining and knowledge discovery methods to data sets from business, industry and government. The course is team oriented, project based and grounded in the relevant legal and ethical context."

IA 340 is a necessary technical course within the [Intelligence Analysis](https://www.jmu.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors/intelligence-analysis.shtml) Program at [James Madison University](https://www.jmu.edu/index.shtml).
